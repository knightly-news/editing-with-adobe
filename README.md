# what-is-github
**Just some insight on how these tutorials work. Skip to the next title for the lesson.**

This is the first repository on the Knightly News Github page. Github is an easy-to-use SAS (software-as-a-service) company which stores your code online, but can also be used as a classroom files storage. I prefer to use Github over Google Drive when teaching this class because of it's features:
* It allows for me to add text and little information along the way
* I get to keep all my files in one designated place and get a direct URL for it
> A good/bad thing to notice is that most things on Github are organized with dashes (-) instead of spaces, and this is just a formatting technique. One of my pet-peeves is when people don't format right... this will keep everything uniform. It took me a while to get used to.
