Learn how to edit with Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2018.

This is the first repository on the Knightly News Github page. Github is an easy-to-use SAS (software-as-a-service) company which stores your code online, but can also be used as a classroom files storage. I prefer to use Github over Google Drive when teaching this class because of it's features:
* It allows for me to add text and little information along the way
* I get to keep all my files in one designated place and get a direct URL for it
